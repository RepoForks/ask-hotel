> An alexa skill to automate hotel operations reducing efforts and time for hotel administration and staff. It can take food orders, and request for other hotel services. All the requests are automatically served and presented to hotel staff in a user friendly dashboard for them to monitor.

## Future Scope
 + Use the data gathered from the requests to loop in as feedback to improve hotel services and evaluate staff performances
 + Improve suggestions from alexa to perform more tasks for guests like booking cabs, suggesting tourists stops and entertainment.
 + Automate and hence optimize route for room service according to presence of people (detected from Alexa) in their room.
